### Previously on "Understanding NCS5500 Resources"

In previous posts, we presented:
- the [different routers and line cards in NCS5500 portfolio](https://xrdocs.github.io/cloud-scale-networking/tutorials/2017-08-02-understanding-ncs5500-resources-s01e01/)  
- we explained [how IPv4 prefixes are sorted in LEM, LPM and eTCAM](https://xrdocs.github.io/cloud-scale-networking/tutorials/2017-08-03-understanding-ncs5500-resources-s01e02/)
- we covered [how IPv6 prefixes are stored in the same databases](https://xrdocs.github.io/cloud-scale-networking/tutorials/2017-08-07-understanding-ncs5500-resources-s01e03/).
- [we demonstrated in a video](https://xrdocs.github.io/cloud-scale-networking/tutorials/2017-12-30-full-internet-view-on-base-ncs-5500-systems-s01e04/) how we can handle a full IPv4 and IPv6 Internet view on "Base" systems and line cards (i.e. without external TCAM, only using the LEM and LPM internal to the forwarding ASIC)
- finally in the fifth post, [we demonstrated in another video](https://xrdocs.github.io/cloud-scale-networking/tutorials/2018-01-25-s01e05-large-routing-tables-on-scale-ncs-5500-systems/) the scale we can reach on Jericho-based systems with an external TCAM

In this episode we will introduce and study a second generation of line cards and systems based on an evolution of the Forwarding ASIC.

### Jericho+

This Forwarding ASIC from Broadcom re-uses all of the principles of the Jericho generation, simply extending some scales:
- the **bandwidth capabilities** and consequently, the interfaces count: we can now accomodate 9x 100G interfaces line rate per ASIC
- the **forwarding capability** , extending it to 835MPPS (the performance is the same with lookups in internal databases or external TCAM)
- some memories like **LPM** (for certain models) and **EEDB**. Also we will use a **new generation eTCAM** (significantly larger).

"Certain models"? Yes, J+ exists in different flavors. Some are re-using the same LEM/LPM scale than Jericho and some others have a larger LPM memory (qualified for 1M to 1.3M instead of 256K to 350+K IPv4 entries).

![J-J+-FE3600.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/J-J+-FE3600.jpg) 

Both Jericho and Jericho+ can be used with current Fabric Cards (FE3600). Some restrictions may apply for the 16-slot chassis, please contact your local account team to discuss the specifics.

### New systems using this J+ ASIC

In the modular chassis:

In March 2018, we had a single line card using Jericho+: the 36x100G-A-SE (more LC are coming in the summer).

![36x100G-SE.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/36x100G-SE.jpg){: .align-center}

The line card is timing capable (note: an RP-E is necessary to use these timing features) and only exists in scale version (with eTCAM). The supported scale in current release is 4M+ IPv4 entries. It does not include MACsec chipset. It's also the first line card supporting break-out cable 4x 25G.

Internally, the line is composed of 4 Jericho+ (each one handling 9 ports QSFP). As shown in this diagram, each Jericho+ Forwarding ASIC is connected to the fabric cards via 8x 25G SERDES instead of 6 in the case of Jericho-based line cards.

![36x100G-SE-1.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/36x100G-SE-1.jpg){: .align-center}

In July 2018, we added the support of MOD line cards: NC55-MOD-A-S

![nc55-mod2.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nc55-mod2.jpg){: .align-center}

This line card offers more flexbility with fixed ports and two MPA bays. It's powered by a single Jericho+ ASIC.

![nc55-mod-block-diagram.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nc55-mod-block-diagram.jpg){: .align-center}


We are also extending the fixed-form factor portfolio with 3x 1RU and 2x 2RU 

- NCS55A1-36H-S
- NCS55A1-36H-SE-S
- NCS55A1-24H
- NCS-55A2-MOD-HD-S
- NCS-55A2-MOD-S

Let's get started with the 36 ports options.

These standalone systems are MACsec + timing capable and are available in base (**NCS55A1-36H-S**) and scale versions (**NCS55A1-36H-SE-S**). Both have the same port density.

The base version shows the same route scale than a Jericho systems without external TCAM while the scale version uses a new generation eTCAM extending the scale to 4M IPv4 routes (potentially much more in the future).

![NCS55A1-36H-SE-S.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/NCS55A1-36H-SE-S.jpg){: .align-center}

Internally, the system is composed of 4 Jericho+ ASICs (each one handling 9 ports QSFP) interconnected via an FE3600 chipset.

![NCS55A1-36H-SE-S-1.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/NCS55A1-36H-SE-S-1.jpg){: .align-center}

The third router: **NCS55A1-24H**. 

It's a cost optimized, oversubscribbed, system that provides 24 ports QSFP. It is timing-capable but doesn't support MACsec.

![NCS55A1-24H.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/NCS55A1-24H.jpg){: .align-center}

As shown in this diagram, the forwarding ASICs are connected back-to-back without using any fabric engine. Each ASIC handles 12 ports for a 900Gbps forwarding capability (hence the oversubscription).

![NCS55A1-24H-1.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/NCS55A1-24H-1.jpg){: .align-center}

We will describe it in more details in the next sections but this system uses the largest version of Jericho+ ASICs. It doesn't use external TCAM but has a large LPM (1M to 1.3M prefixes instead of the 256K-350K we use on other systems in chassis or in the NCS55A1-36H-S).

Moving on the second category, the **2-RU Modular Fixed Systems**:

Modular and Fixed... Hmmm...  

Indeed these routers are not chassis in the sense they don't have slots to host line cards, but still they offer a lot of flexbility. They offer both fixed ports (40x SFP+) and two bays to host MPAs:  
- 12x 10G, with 10G LAN, WAN, OTN, 10G DWDM 
- 2x CFP2_DCO (OTN, 100G/200G DWDM) 
- 1x CFP2_DCO (OTN, 100G/200G DWDM) + 2x QSFP28 (4x10G / 40G / 100G) 
- 4x QSFP28 (4x10G / 40G /100G) 

In 6.5.1, we offer two flavors of the chassis: base and hardened. The second being temperature hardened, it can support more challenging environmental conditions.

![55a2-mod.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/55a2-mod.jpg){: .align-center}

The system is powered by a single Jericho+ and is capable of MACsec on the 16 first ports and on MPAs.

![ncs55a2-mod-block-diagram.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ncs55a2-mod-block-diagram.jpg){: .align-center}


### Let's talk about route scale

First, a quick reminder: the order of operation for route lookup in the NCS5500 family. It applies for both Jericho and Jericho+ systems.

![lookup-process.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lookup-process.jpg){: .align-center}

The prefixes are stored in LEM, LPM and when possible eTCAM.

### NCS55A1-36H-S / NCS-55A2-MOD-HD-S / NCS-55A2-MOD-S Scale

On these systems, the principles of prefixes storage are exactly the same than Jericho systems without eTCAM.

So it's possible to use two different modes:

- by default: the host mode

![36H-S-host.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/36H-S-host.jpg){: .align-center}

- changed by configuration: the internet mode

![36H-S-internet.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/36H-S-internet.jpg){: .align-center}

I invite you take a look at the [second](https://xrdocs.github.io/cloud-scale-networking/tutorials/2017-08-03-understanding-ncs5500-resources-s01e02/) and [third](https://xrdocs.github.io/cloud-scale-networking/tutorials/2017-08-07-understanding-ncs5500-resources-s01e03/) episode of this series. You will find detailed explanations and examples with real internet views.

### NCS55A1-36H-SE-S Scale

The NCS55A1-36H-SE-S is using the same Jericho+ ASIC but completed with a new generation and much larger external TCAM. In current release, it's certified for 4M IPv4 prefixes but the memory capabilities are significantly larger. We will decide in the future if it's necessary to increase the tested/validated scale.

Also, please note that the way we sort routes is different between 6.3.15 and 6.3.2. 

![6315-632.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/6315-632.jpg){: .align-center}

The [uRPF](https://xrdocs.github.io/cloud-scale-networking/tutorials/ncs5500-urpf/) does not affect the scale of this eTCAM (on the contrary of the first generation where it was necessary to disable the dual capacity feature, reducing the eTCAM to 1M entries). Also, the hybrid ACLs are using a different zone of the eTCAM memory and don't affect the overall scale.

### NCS55A1-24H Scale

The NCS55A1-24H is very different from the other NCS5500 routers because it uses a pair of Jericho+ with large LPM. So it occupies a particular place between the non-eTCAM and the eTCAM systems.

This large LPM is algorithmic, so even if it's marketed for 1M IPv4 entries, it can fit much more depending on the prefix distribution:

Like the other non-eTCAM systems, we can use two different configurations: the host-optimized mode (default) and the internet-optimized mode.

![24H-host-internet.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/24H-host-internet.jpg){: .align-center}

Let's take a full internet table made of 655487 v4 and 42852 v6 real routes
and check how it fits in this system.

With the host optimized mode:

![24h-host.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/24h-host.jpg){: .align-center}

And with the internet optimized mode:

![24h-internet.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/24h-internet.jpg){: .align-center}

### Conclusion

Three different options with the Jericho+ systems: J+ with Jericho-scale, J+ with large LPM, J+ with new generation eTCAM. They are used in one new line card offering very high route scalability (4M+ routes), and in three new 1RU systems.
