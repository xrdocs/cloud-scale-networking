## Introduction
This blog is the first in a series about IOS XR’s software architecture. I believe that many of today’s best-practice architecture/design patterns for a successful buildout of scalable network system, are rooted in the IOS XR's architecture.

In this series, I will explore the part of IOS XR that is typically invisible, and describe IOS XR's architecture from its foundations up. I go into why the architecture looks like it does, introduce key design patterns, and draw occasional parallels with other scalable and high-performance software.
