The latest multi-vendor interoperability event organized by the European Advanced Networking Test Center (EANTC) took place in Berlin, Germany from March, 2nd to March, 13th 2020. In order to protect the health of our employees and other participants from COVID-19, the Service Provider team at Cisco made the tough decision to opt-out from the event.

As a result, you will not see Cisco IOS-XR routing platforms - ASR 9000, NCS 5500 or NCS 540 - be part of the test results publicly shared by EANTC on March, 31st 2020.
