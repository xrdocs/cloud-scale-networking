## A New Post

The 2020 EANTC Multi-Vendor Interoperability event took place in Berlin from March, 2nd to March, 13th 2020. To protect our employees and others from the COVID-19 pandemic that was exploding in Europe at the time, the Service Provider team made the tough decision to opt-out from this year’s event.

As a result, you won’t see any Cisco IOS-XR routing platforms - ASR9K, NCS5500 or NCS540 - be part of the test results publicly shared by EANTC on March, 31st.
