## An update on Cisco's Service Provider line of business at EANTC 2020 Interop event  

The 2020 EANTC Multi-Vendor Interoperability event took place in Berlin from March, 2nd to March, 13th 2020. In order to protect our employees and other participants from COVID-19, the Service Provider team made the tough decision to opt-out from this yearâ€™s event.

As a result, you will not see Cisco IOS-XR routing platforms - ASR9K, NCS5500 or NCS540 - be part of the test results publicly shared by EANTC on March, 31st 2020.
